One common thing I hear from beginners learning how to to code, is "How can I stay motivated to keep learning?" or "How can I find the discipline to keep going?".

My answer for them is simple, don't chase motivation but instead aim for discipline.

## Where did my motivation go?

When you are first learning, you will probably have tons of motivation and excitement for starting the journey. You probably have bought a few Udemy courses and maybe built your first small web app.

But then, a month or two goes by and you hit a wall. The motivation is gone and you are left with the reality of how much you still have to learn. You start to wonder if you are cut out for this. You start to wonder if you should just give up.

The good news is that most people feel this way. The bad news is that most people give up at this point.
